# dime_cadence

Dime is a user-friendly NFT marketplace built on Flow. We set prices in USD,
manage user keys using AWS KMS, and generally abstract blockchain operations 
to allow users with little experience to buy and sell on the platform. This
repo contains our core contracts for a Dime Collectible (the NFT users create)
and a Dime Storefront, which allows users to sell their NFTs.
